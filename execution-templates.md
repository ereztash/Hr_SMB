## Translated into Concrete Tasks & Outputs

---

# TEMPLATE 1: BLUE OCEAN POSITIONING GENERATOR

## Purpose:
עזר למקצוע שנתקעו בRed Ocean לגלות וליצור Blue Ocean positioning.

## Input:
- Current positioning (from Diagnostic)
- Target audience segment
- Unique background / expertise

## Process:

### Step 1: Deconstruct the Current Game

**User Task**:
"תן לי את 5 dimensions של הpositioner הנוכחי שלך:"
1. Who you claim to help: [audience]
2. What problem you solve: [problem]
3. How you solve it: [method]
4. What makes you different: [differentiation]
5. What result you create: [outcome]

**Agent Analysis**:
- לכל dimension, שאל: "מה כולם בתחום שלך עושים?"
- זהה: הdominant game הנוכחי

### Step 2: Identify Elimination, Reduction, Raise, Create (ERRC Matrix)

**Eliminate**: What do competitors do שלא צריך?
- Example: If all consultants do "long engagements", eliminate that → "asynchronous self-serve frameworks"

**Reduce**: What factors should be reduced?
- Example: If all consultants claim "premium expertise", reduce that → "we solve narrow problem deeply, not everything"

**Raise**: What factors should be amplified?
- Example: Instead of "professional advisory", raise → "founder transformation, emotionally"

**Create**: What new factors didn't exist?
- Example: Create → "community support structure" (not available from solo consultants)

**User Output Template**:
```
ELIMINATE (what we DON'T do that competitors do):
- [factor 1 to remove]
- [factor 2 to remove]

REDUCE (factors to minimize):
- [factor 1: from X to Y]
- [factor 2: from X to Y]

RAISE (factors to emphasize more):
- [factor 1: from X to Y]
- [factor 2: from X to Y]

CREATE (new factors not available):
- [new factor 1]
- [new factor 2]
```

### Step 3: New Positioning Statement (Blue Ocean Version)

**Template**:
"We serve [specific audience] who are [specific situation], by [new method competitors don't use], creating [specific outcome], in [differentiated way]."

**Example Outputs**:
- Red Ocean: "Executive coach for founders"
- Blue Ocean: "I help distributed engineering teams hit productivity benchmarks by designing organization structure BEFORE hiring, typically reducing time-to-hire by 40%"

# TEMPLATE 2: SIGNAL PRIORITY MAPPER

## Purpose:
עזר למקצוע להבין איזה signals להתחיל עם, בהתאם לsector שלהם.

## Input:
- Target sector (Tech, Consulting, Finance, Academic, etc.)
- Current signal inventory (from Diagnostic)
- Time/resources available

## Process:

### Step 1: Sector Signal Hierarchy (Pre-built)

**Tech Sector - Top Signals** (in order):
1. **Shipped Products** - actual working product, users using it
2. **GitHub Profile** - code quality, contribution history
3. **Publications** - technical writing, thought leadership
4. **Certifications** - degree, bootcamp (least important)

**Consulting Sector - Top Signals**:
1. **Case Studies** - specific client, specific problem, specific result
2. **Speaking Engagements** - conferences, visibility, credibility by association
3. **Publications** - articles, research, frameworks
4. **Credentials** - MBA, degree, certifications

**Finance Sector - Top Signals**:
1. **Track Record** - returns, performance, verifiable results
2. **Credentials** - CFA, regulatory licenses, affiliation with known firms
3. **Publications** - industry research, data-backed articles
4. **Network** - affiliations with prestigious firms/people

**Academic Sector - Top Signals**:
1. **Publications** - peer-reviewed journals, citations
2. **Credentials** - PhD, prestigious institutions
3. **Network** - collaborators, co-authors
4. **Speaking** - conferences, seminars

### Step 2: Current vs. Ideal Gap Analysis

**User Task**:
"Mark which signals you have (Y/N) and strength (1-5)":

| Signal Type | Have? | Strength | Priority | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Top signal #1] | Y/N | 1-5 | 1 | ___ |
| [Top signal #2] | Y/N | 1-5 | 2 | ___ |
| [Top signal #3] | Y/N | 1-5 | 3 | ___ |

**Agent Analysis**:
- Gap = Missing signals in top 3 priorities
- Priority action = Fill highest-impact gap first

# TEMPLATE 3: HALO AMPLIFIER FRAMEWORK

## Purpose:
עזר למקצוע להבין את ה-mega-trait שלהם וליצור mental model מוחד בקהל.

## Input:
- Current perception among peers
- Natural strengths
- Unique background

## Process:

### Step 1: Mega-Trait Discovery

**User Task**: Complete this sentence 5 ways:
1. "People often say I'm unusually good at: ___"
2. "The one thing clients thank me for most is: ___"
3. "In my industry, I'm known for: ___"
4. "My closest friend would say my superpower is: ___"
5. "If I had to pick ONE thing that differentiates me, it's: ___"

**Agent Analysis**:
- Look for commonality across answers
- If scattered = no clear mega-trait
- If consistent = found it

### Step 2: Halo Amplification Strategy

**Once Mega-Trait Identified**, create strategy to amplify it:

| Channel | How to Amplify Mega-Trait |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **LinkedIn** | Lead with it in: headline, first sentence of profile, first post topic |
| **Speaking** | Open with it: "I'm known for [trait], here's why it matters..." |
| **Content** | 70% of content should directly showcase this trait |
| **First Meeting** | Mention it in first 5 minutes naturally |
| **Portfolio** | Show 3-5 best examples of this trait in action |
| **Testimonials** | Ask clients to mention this specific trait |

### Step 3: Horn Effect Audit (If Exists)

**User Task**: 
"Is there ONE negative perception that overrides the halo?"

Examples:
- Negative: "Too young" / "Too old" / "Job-hopped" / "Failed visibly"

If yes:
- Priority #1: Fix the horn BEFORE amplifying halo
- Strategy: Address it proactively in first meeting/profile
- Timeline: Can take 6-12 months to recover from horn effect

# TEMPLATE 4: LOSS AVERSION REFRAMING

## Purpose:
עזר למקצוע להתגבר על status quo bias וloss aversion לreposition משמעותי.

## Input:
- Current fears about repositioning (from Diagnostic)
- Actual vs. anticipated losses
- Time horizon

## Process:

### Step 1: Fear Inventory

**User Task**: "List 3-5 fears about repositioning:"
1. [Fear 1]: "I'll lose my credibility in my current niche"
2. [Fear 2]: "My network won't understand the shift"
3. [Fear 3]: "It will take months with no income"
4. [Fear 4]: "I'm not sure if the new positioning is even real"
5. [Fear 5]: [Your fear]

### Step 2: Reality Testing Each Fear

**For Each Fear**, Agent runs:

**Question Pattern**:
1. "What's the WORST case scenario for this fear?"
   - Record actual outcome, timeline, impact

2. "How likely is this worst case?" (probability %)
   - Scoring: <10% = unlikely; 50%+ = real risk

3. "If it happened, what could you do?"
   - Identify recovery options (pivot back? adjust? continue?)

4. "How many people have repositioned successfully despite this risk?"
   - Identify counterexamples

**Example - Fear: "I'll lose my credibility"**
```
Worst case: Current network sees me as confused/fickle
Probability: 30%
Recovery: Can explain evolution, not pivot; highlight niche deepening
Counter-examples: 10+ examples of successful niche narrowing (actually improved perception)
```

### Step 3: Reframing the Repositioning

**Offer 3 Framing Options**:

**Framing A: "Evolution"**
- "I'm not pivoting away from expertise, I'm going deeper into the core of what I do"
- Loss language: Minimal
- Best for: When repositioning is niche-deepening

**Framing B: "Reclamation"**
- "I've always been this way, I'm finally claiming it"
- Loss language: Minimal
- Best for: When you're returning to roots

**Framing C: "Experiment"**
- "I'm testing positioning for 90 days; we'll see if it resonates"
- Loss language: Temporary, reversible
- Best for: When significant change, want low commitment

**User Choice**: Pick framing that feels most authentic

### Step 4: Micro-Commitment Strategy

**Small Steps Over Large Leap**:

Instead of: Announce new positioning to everyone at once
Do: Phase it in via:

- **Week 1**: Update LinkedIn headline only
- **Week 2**: Test new positioning with 3 warm contacts
- **Week 3**: Write 1 article in new framing
- **Week 4**: Use new positioning in 5 new conversations
- **Week 5**: Update full LinkedIn profile
- **Month 2+**: Build social proof in new positioning

This reduces loss aversion by:
- Testing before full commitment
- Getting feedback early
- Allowing reversal if needed
- Building evidence as you go

# TEMPLATE 5: SOCIAL PROOF BOOTSTRAPPER

## Purpose:
עזר למקצוע שעם zero social proof לבנות first credible proof.

## Input:
- Recent projects/clients
- Network willing to support
- Time available

## Process:

### Step 1: Find Your "Proof Seed"

**User Task**: "Identify 1 client/project where you can document results clearly:"
- What problem did you solve?
- What was the outcome? (with number if possible)
- How long did it take?
- Can you get permission to document?

### Step 2: Build First Proof Piece

**Option A: Detailed Case Study** (Most credible, most work)
```
CASE STUDY: [Client Name - anonymized if needed]
Company: [size, industry, stage]
Challenge: [specific problem, quantified if possible]
Approach: [what you did, 3-5 steps]
Results: [quantified outcome, timeline, impact]
Client Quote: "..." - [Name], [Title]
```
- Time to build: 20-40 hours
- Credibility: High
- Reusability: Very high (can be repurposed)

**Option B: Testimonial + Story** (Medium credible, medium work)
```
"I worked with [professional] on [specific problem]. The result was [outcome]. 
What impressed me was [specific detail]." - [Name], [Title]

Why this worked: [1-2 paragraph explanation of what happened]
```
- Time to build: 5-10 hours
- Credibility: Medium
- Reusability: Medium

**Option C: Before/After Documentation** (Quick, decent credibility)
```
BEFORE: [situation/metrics before working with you]
AFTER: [situation/metrics after]
TIMELINE: [how long it took]
CLIENT: [willing to vouch?]
```
- Time to build: 5 hours
- Credibility: Medium-low
- Reusability: Medium

### Step 3: Distribution Strategy

Once you have 1 proof piece:
- **LinkedIn**: Post it as article (get views, engagement)
- **Website**: Feature prominently
- **Outreach**: Link it in cold emails to prospects
- **Social Proof**: Use in pitches to new clients

### Step 4: Proof Flywheel

After first proof:
- **Week 2**: "If I helped Client A with X, I can likely help others with X. Interested in exploring?"
- **Week 3**: Land Client B (has strong proof that it works)
- **Week 4**: Build proof for Client B (now you have 2)
- **Week 5+**: Each new client = 1 new proof point; flywheel accelerates

# TEMPLATE 6: CONFORMITY BREAKOUT FRAMEWORK

## Purpose:
עזר למקצוע להבין איפה הם over-conforming וליצור authentic differentiation.

## Input:
- Current positioning (from Diagnostic)
- Sector norms
- Unique background

## Process:

### Step 1: Sector Norm Mapping

**User Task**: "Map the norm in your field:"

| Dimension | The Norm | You | Difference |
|-----------|----------|-----|-----------|
| **Experience** | 15-20 years | [?] | [?] |
| **Credentials** | MBA, [cert] | [?] | [?] |
| **Approach** | [method] | [?] | [?] |
| **Niche** | [typical niche] | [?] | [?] |
| **Price** | $[X] per engagement | [?] | [?] |

### Step 2: Identify Over-Conformity

**Agent Analysis**:
- Which rows are you identical to norm?
- Which rows are you different?
- Of the different rows - which is actually a strength?

**Example**:
- Norm: "15-20 years experience" / You: "8 years but hyper-specialized"
- Over-conforming? Maybe (claiming experience you don't have)
- Better differentiation: Own the "specialist" angle, not experience
- New claim: "Specialized 8 years beats generic 20 years"

### Step 3: White Space Identification

**User Task**: "What positioning does NOBODY in your field claim?"

Examples:
- Norm: "Strategic consulting for tech companies"
- White space: "Regulatory compliance strategy for AI companies"

- Norm: "Executive coach for founders"
- White space: "Coach specializing in founder psychological resilience in downturns"

- Norm: "Organizational consultant"
- White space: "Org design specifically for transitioning from founder-led to CEO-led"

### Step 4: Differentiation Authenticity Check

**Before claiming white space**, check:
1. "Can I credibly back this up?" (do you have proof?)
2. "Is this because I'm truly different, or just trying to be contrarian?"
3. "Will my target audience actually value this difference?"

If yes to all 3 → Safe to differentiate
If no → Need to either build proof first OR find different white space

# TEMPLATE 7: NETWORK STICKINESS BUILDER

## Purpose:
עזר למקצוע לבנות קהילה עם real lock-in, לא רק followers.

## Input:
- Current communities
- Target audience segments
- Available time/resources

## Process:

### Step 1: Community Health Assessment

**For Each Community You're In**:

| Community | Role | Frequency | Stickiness | Growth |
|-----------|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| [Name] | Passive/Active/Leader | Weekly/Monthly | Low/Med/High | Yes/No |
| [Name] | Passive/Active/Leader | Weekly/Monthly | Low/Med/High | Yes/No |

**Scoring Stickiness** (1-10):
- 1-3: People forget you exist when you're silent
- 4-6: People remember you; they'd miss you if you left
- 7-10: You're irreplaceable; they actively depend on you

### Step 2: Identify Highest-ROI Community

Choose ONE community where:
- Stickiness is already medium-high (7+)
- OR there's high growth potential but low stickiness (needs leadership)

### Step 3: Move from Consumption to Leadership

**Current State** (consuming):
- You participate in discussions
- You ask questions
- You learn from others

**Leadership State** (leading):
- You facilitate connections between members
- You host office hours, AMA, events
- You curate content
- You create structure/value for the community

**Simple Actions to Shift**:
1. Start: "I'm noticing [problem] in our community. Want to solve it together?"
2. Propose: "I'd like to run a weekly [discussion/office hours/workshop]"
3. Execute: Commit to 1 time/week for 3 months
4. Expand: Once locked in, add more value-add

### Step 4: Network Flywheel

```
Lead → Visibility → Trust → Referrals → Growth → Stickiness
```

Once you're leading:
- Community members tell others: "You need to know [you]"
- Network effect: Each member brings similar people
- Lock-in: Hard to leave because they depend on community you're running

# TEMPLATE 8: AUTHENTICITY POSITIONING GUIDE

## Purpose:
עזר למקצוע לבנות authentic positioning שמעמיד ערך בלי להיות over-shared/vulnerable.

## Input:
- Real challenges/background
- Strategic goals
- Risk tolerance

## Process:

### Step 1: Authenticity Audit

**User Task**: "For each element of your positioning, rate authenticity:"

| Positioning Element | Authentic? | If Not - Why? |
|---|---|---|
| "I help [audience]" | Y/N | [reason] |
| "With problem [X]" | Y/N | [reason] |
| "Using [method]" | Y/N | [reason] |
| "Creating [outcome]" | Y/N | [reason] |

Red flag: If ANY element is >20% inauthentic = positioning won't sustain

### Step 2: The Vulnerability Calibration

**Not all vulnerability is equally valuable**:

**🚫 Avoid**:
- Vulnerability to signal relatability when it doesn't connect to your expertise
- Over-sharing personal drama
- Fishing for sympathy
- Manufactured "struggles"

**✅ Leverage**:
- Relevant struggles (if you struggled with X, you understand clients facing X)
- Professional pivots (showing learning, not just success)
- Client failures (what you learned that helps current clients)
- Decision-making transparency (why you chose this positioning)

**Example - Good Vulnerability**:
```
"I spent 5 years as a generalist consultant. It was unsustainable - I was mediocre at everything.
When I narrowed to 'distributed team org design', two things happened:
1. My work got much better (deeper expertise)
2. My peace of mind improved (no longer pretending to know everything)
Now I help founders avoid that trap."
```

This connects your struggle → your positioning → client benefit

### Step 3: Strategic Disclosure Boundaries

**Build your boundaries framework**:

| Category | Share? | How Much? | Channel |
|----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Professional growth journey | Yes | Medium | LinkedIn, interviews |
| Client wins | Yes | High detail | Case studies, testimonials |
| Failures/learning | Yes | Medium (lesson focused) | Long-form content |
| Personal mental health | Maybe | Low | Only if directly relevant |
| Financial struggles | No | - | Too risky |
| Political views | No | - | Alienates audience |

### Step 4: Authenticity Sustainability Test

**Before finalizing positioning, ask**:

1. "Can I maintain this framing 2 years from now?"
   - If yes → Sustainable
   - If no → Too stretched / inauthentic

2. "If I tell this story 100 times, would I get tired of it?"
   - If no → Good positioning
   - If yes → It's not deeply authentic

3. "Could the opposite be equally true about me?"
   - If yes → You're hedging; pick a real position
   - If no → You've found something genuine
