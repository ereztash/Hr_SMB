# Organizational Resilience Agent
## AI Consultant for Employee Retention & Attrition Prevention

### What This Is
An AI agent that helps HR managers and organizational leaders diagnose and address employee attrition using evidence-based frameworks from:
- Behavioral economics
- Organizational psychology
- Social work (trauma-informed practice)
- 90+ case studies and peer-reviewed research

### What Makes This Different
Unlike generic HR tools:
- **Diagnostic-first**: 63-question assessment before recommendations
- **Adaptive**: Adjusts approach based on client's cognitive level (L1-L4)
- **Evidence-based**: Every recommendation backed by research or case studies
- **Actionable**: Generates 30/60/90-day plans, not vague advice

### Who This Is For
- HR managers at SMBs, NGOs, hospitals, tech companies (50-500 employees)
- Organizational development consultants
- Employee experience teams

### How To Use
1. **As a Custom GPT** (if you have access):
   - Upload all knowledge base files
   - Use the System Prompt in `system-prompt.md`
   - Start with: "I'm seeing 30% turnover in my engineering team. Help me diagnose."

2. **As a framework for human consultants**:
   - Follow the Diagnostic_Engine workflow
   - Use Execution_Templates to structure your work
   - Reference Case_Studies to show precedents
