## ADAPTIVE WEIGHTING SYSTEM

### Regime-Based Weighting
Weights adjust based on organizational regime:

**Crisis Regime (OHS < 4):**
- Epistemic Tremor: 5x (trust is critical)
- Psychological Safety: 4x
- Attrition Baseline: 4x
- Others: Standard weights

**Routine Regime (OHS 4-7):**
- Standard weights as listed

**Growth Regime (OHS > 7):**
- Network Analysis: 3x (scaling requires connectivity)
- Change Capacity: 3x
- Innovation: 3x
- Others: Reduced weights

### Sector-Specific Adjustments
**Tech/Startup:**
- Increase weight on Change Capacity (2x → 3x)
- Increase weight on Network (2x → 3x)

**Healthcare/NGO:**
- Increase weight on Psychological Safety (3x → 4x)
- Increase weight on Leadership Quality (2x → 3x)

**Finance/Legal:**
- Increase weight on Compliance/Rules (if applicable)
- Increase weight on Measurement & Transparency

---

## DATA COLLECTION PROTOCOL

### 1. Survey Deployment
- **Audience:** All employees (or stratified sample if N > 500)
- **Anonymity:** Guaranteed; Privacy-by-Design
- **Length:** ~15 minutes (63 questions)
- **Frequency:** Quarterly (or monthly if in crisis regime)

### 2. Behavioral Data (Passive Collection)
- **Email Sentiment:** NLP analysis (sentiment scores)
- **Meeting Patterns:** ONA from calendar data
- **Slack/Communication:** Sentiment, frequency, network analysis
- **HR Data:** Attrition, tenure, promotions, absenteeism
- **Performance Data:** If available and anonymous

### 3. Interviews (Qualitative)
- **Stay Interviews:** 10-15 employees (stratified sample)
- **Exit Interviews:** All voluntary departures
- **Leader Interviews:** 3-5 senior leaders

### 4. Data Integration
- Combine survey (declared), behavioral (actual), and qualitative (context)
- Calculate Loss Contradiction: ρ(survey_responses, behavioral_data)

---

## VALIDATION & CALIBRATION

### Predictive Accuracy
- **Target:** OHS predicts 6-month attrition with 85%+ accuracy
- **Method:** Backtesting on historical data (V&V Phase 1)

### False Positive/Negative Rates
- **False Alarm Rate:** <15% (avoid alert fatigue)
- **Missed Crisis Rate:** <5% (critical to catch early)

### Continuous Calibration
- Update weights based on:
  - Intervention outcomes (what worked?)
  - Predictive accuracy (which signals mattered?)
  - Sector-specific patterns

---

## ETHICS & SAFEGUARDS

### 1. Privacy-by-Design
- All data anonymized at collection
- Aggregate analysis only (no individual tracking)
- GDPR compliant

### 2. Transparency (XAI)
- Every recommendation includes reasoning
- "Why this score?" explanations in plain language
- Decision log auditable

### 3. Bounded Self-Modification
- Agent cannot modify core diagnostic questions
- Weights can adjust within bounds (±30%)
- Human oversight required for major changes

### 4. No Harm Principle
- Recommendations prioritize employee well-being
- Reject interventions that increase burnout risk
- Flag recommendations that may cause layoffs (require explicit human approval)

## INTEGRATION WITH 4-TOWER ARCHITECTURE

### Tower 1: Data Platform (EDA)
- Ingests survey, behavioral, HR data
- Real-time event streams (email sent, meeting scheduled, employee departed)

### Tower 2: Symptom Engines
- NLP Sentiment: Scores email/Slack sentiment → Maps to Section B, E
- ONA: Calculates network metrics → Maps to Section F
- Meeting Analysis: Detects participation, dynamics → Maps to Section B

### Tower 3: Causal Engines
- Loss Contradiction: Computes ρ(declared, behavioral) → Section D
- CSD/EWS: Monitors variance, autocorrelation, recovery → Section G
- Ricci Curvature (GNN): Network fragility → Section F

### Tower 4: Unified Brain (MCDM)
- Integrates all section scores
- Applies regime-based weighting
- Generates prioritized intervention list
- Routes to appropriate Daughter Agent (Playbook module)

## SYSTEM PROMPT INTEGRATION

When ACA Diagnostic Engine runs, it follows this prompt:

```
You are the ACA Diagnostic Engine. Your role:

1. Collect responses to 63 questions across 12 sections
2. Calculate section scores using weighted algorithm
3. Compute Organizational Health Score (OHS)
4. Identify: Epistemic Tremor, CSD signals, Loss Spirals, Network Fragility
5. Map findings to theoretical frameworks (JD-R, MBI, COR, Game Theory, etc.)
6. Generate diagnostic report with:
   - Executive summary
   - Section analysis
   - Risk flags
   - Prioritized interventions
   - 30-60-90 day roadmap
7. Use Dual-Lens analysis (logical + emotional)
8. Apply Socratic Method in follow-up dialogue
9. Ensure Privacy-by-Design, XAI, Decision Log

Output format: Structured JSON + Human-readable report
Tone: Evidence-based, non-judgmental, actionable
Confidence: Always state confidence level and data limitations
```
